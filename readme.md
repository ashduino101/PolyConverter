# PolyConverter

This small program will convert Poly Bridge 2 layout files (from the sandbox/workshop)
into an easily-editable text format.

It will be helpful if you need to merge layouts together, or edit parts of your level
that can't normally be edited, such as object depth (Z coordinate).


### How to use

Place PolyConverter.exe inside any folder that has .layout files in it
(the game stores them in `Documents\Dry Cactus\Poly Bridge 2\Sandbox`).  
When you run it, the .layout files will be converted into .json files.  
By pressing Enter to run the program again, all the changes you made in the .json files
will be applied to the .layout files.
A backup of the original .layout file (before any changes) will be created the first time.  
You can keep applying new changes as many times as you want without having to close the window.
